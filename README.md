Welcome to the fablulous Crsytal Collector game!

THANKS FOR CHECKING THIS OUT

PURPOSE OF THE GAME
This is a great game to test your memory skills and alertness.

GETTING STARTED
To get started just click on any crystal and try to remember the value of each crystal.  Can you 
remember the value of 4 different crystals? If so use your enhanced memory skills to match your 
point total to the Computer total....but stay sharp because the value of each crystal resets
for every game.

CODE
This coding project is a great way to test and stretch your beginner javascript skills.
